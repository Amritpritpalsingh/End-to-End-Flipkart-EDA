# 📱 Flipkart Smartphone Data Analysis (End-to-End Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis pipeline built using smartphone data scraped from Flipkart.  
It demonstrates real-world data handling skills including **web scraping**, **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Scrape smartphone data from Flipkart
- Clean and preprocess raw e-commerce data
- Perform feature extraction (RAM, ROM, Display, Prices)
- Analyze pricing trends based on specifications
- Generate insights using visualizations

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📥 Data Collection
Smartphone product data was scraped from Flipkart using BeautifulSoup and Requests.  
The raw dataset includes product name, memory specifications, display details, prices, and discounts.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Key preprocessing steps:
- Removed currency symbols and commas from prices
- Converted RAM and ROM values to numeric (GB)
- Extracted display size and display type
- Handled missing and invalid values
- Standardized categorical features

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand:
- Distribution of brands, RAM, ROM, and display types
- Relationship between RAM/ROM and price
- Brand-wise price comparison
- Price differences between original and discounted prices

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Most smartphones fall within the 4GB–8GB RAM range
- 64GB and 128GB ROM are the most common storage options
- Prices increase significantly with higher RAM and ROM
- Certain brands consistently operate in premium price segments

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using real-world e-commerce data.  
It is suitable for data analyst and data science portfolios.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build a machine learning model to predict smartphone prices
- Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- Automate scraping for periodic data updates
